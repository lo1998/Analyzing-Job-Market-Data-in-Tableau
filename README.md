Case Study: Analyzing Job Market Data in Tableau


In the Tableau case study, I delved into a fictional job posting dataset to assist DataSearch, a fictional recruitment company, in understanding the most sought-after skills for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. My journey began with importing and cleaning the dataset to ensure it was ready for exploration. Utilizing filters and calculated fields, I crafted visualizations to uncover trends and insights within the data. Finally, I consolidated my findings into interactive dashboards using Tableau's robust capabilities, enabling me to address questions from the DataSearch team effectively. Through this hands-on experience, I honed my Tableau skills and gained confidence in presenting data insights with clarity and impact.
